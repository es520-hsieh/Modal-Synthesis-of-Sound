To practice the implementation of Modal Synthesis, I analyze two chosen sound files (Gsp_ME_p_L-sus_F#5.wav, Gsp_ME_f_L-sus_F#6.wav) by examining its waveform, identify the highest magnitude and its corresponding frequency at two distinct time points via spectral analysis, observe the amplitude envelope of these spectra at those time points, utilize this information to synthesize new sounds, and finally, compose a melody incorporating various pitches with different frequencies.
